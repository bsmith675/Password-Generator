**Mission**

The mission was to create a password generator that meets acceptance criteria such as a working button, proper password criteria, length of password must be 8-128 characters, display confirmation of character types, validate input and select at least one character type, when password is generated it meets selected criteria, and lastly the password is displayed on the screen in the fashion you deem fit. 

**Javascript**

-Made sure to provide an array of characters consisting of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers

-I also made sure to create function to perform the task of asking various questions which are displayed through the use of variables.

-Then I used if execute the code and specify that it is true.

-The alert allowed for the process of displaying a virtual alert box. 

-I then created a function to generate the password and used if to once again specify a true value. 

-i is used to identify different variables within the function.
